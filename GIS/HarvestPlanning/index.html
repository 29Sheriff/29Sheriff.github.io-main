                                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Forest managers must ensure that forest operations do not disrupt ecosystems
                                    	or habitats of mammals and similar forest-dwelling species, especially if they are <em>Endangered</em> or <em>Threatened</em>. This normally means that careful planning that considers the presence of these species is always a necessity in forestry activities such as timber logging or harvesting. Indeed several provincial and federal conservation regulations enjoin
                                    	forest and natural resource managers to make adequate provisions in their management plans to protect ecosystems and habitats of forest-dwelling species during operations such as timber logging. In Northern-Interior BC, one species that is constantly threatened by logging activities is the <em>Myotis Lucifugus</em>, commonly called the <strong>Little Brown Bat</strong>. (For more on this particular species, check out this <a href="myotis_lucifugus.pdf">handout</a>). In this project, I explore options for conserving <em>Myotis lucifugus</em> habitat during a logging operation in the Prince George-Mackenzie-Peace River Forest districts in BC. Some of the main considerations were:<br>
                                            <ol style="font-size: 16px;">
                                                <li>What Biogeoclimatic (BEC) Zone types are Little Brown Bats mostly found in?</li>
                                                <li>What proportion of Little Brown Bats are present in each BEC zone?</li>
                                                <li>How much forest area is non-loggable as a result of the presence of Little Brown Bats?</li>
                                            </ol></p>

                                        <p style="font-size: 16px;">I use various GIS analysis and workflows to explore these and other considerations in the succeeding sections</p>

                                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">I began the project by collecting the necessary data I needed for the analysis.

                                    <ul style="font-size: 16px;">
                                        <li>Getting all the data into the right coordinate projections</li>
                                        <li>Joining and merging several of the data to allow analysis to be performed</li>
                                        <li>Cliping several of the data (eg. the water and stream network data and BEC zone data) to conform to specific parts or sections of the study area</li>
                                        <li>Performed other cleaning and preprocessing tasks necessary</li>

                                    </ul>

                                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Having performed the preprocessing and cleaning, and being convinced the data was ready for analysis, I began with some simple statistical procedures to answer some of the main questions.

                                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">To better understand Little Brown Bat habitat trends wthin the study area, such as what proportion of these species are found in each Biogeoclimatic Zone, I first performed a spatial join on the BEC Zone and the <em>myotis lucifugus</em> datasets. Initially, the myotis datasets had to be converted from csv table format to point feature class prior to performing that spatial join. Afterwards, I performed a statistical summary on the point locations dataset of observed habitats of Little Brown Bats to determine their proportion and percentages within each biogeoclimatic zone in the study area. The results I obtained are illustrated in the table below:</p>

                         <p style="font-size: 16px;">As is clear from the table and chart above, forested areas within Boreal White and Black Spruce (BWBS), and Englemann Spruce - Sub-Alpine Fir (ESSF) ecological zones won't see much logging due to the presence of <em>Myotis lucifugus</em> habitat. In 2012, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_the_Status_of_Endangered_Wildlife_in_Canada"><strong>the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada</strong></a>, following an emergency evaluation, listed the <em>Myotis lucifugus</em> as an endangered species. Four years previously, it was considered by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN"><strong>IUCN</strong></a> to be of least conservation concern</p>. <p style="font-size: 16px;"> This status was changed in 2018, however, following an evaluation by the IUCN, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species"><strong>endangered species</strong></a>. Hence, during activities like logging, it is critical for foresters to make appropriate provisions for conserving myotis habitats within logging areas. Some of this provisions could include ensuring that preferred nesting eco zones for Little Brown Bats are preserved, and are within acceptable distance from areas they use for foraging.</p><br>

                                    <br>


                                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">After completing the spatial analysis, I created a map - or rather, 2 maps - to illustrate the results. This wasn't an easy task as naturally I am more partial to the analysis side of GIS than the cartographic side. I accepted a long time ago that I am no artist, and I've made my peace with that. Nevertheless, I tried my best to scramble up a decent map for this project, something that would make sense to a non-cartographic audience. I used both landscape and portrait orientations to see which of them could best illustrate the results of the analysis. The 2 maps are shown below:</p>


                                    <p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/xDbnvj9/Conservation-Map-prtrt.png" alt="map-portrait" border="2px;" class="center0"></p>

                                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">I like the portrait orientation as it enable the most critical portions of the map to be easily displayed. Most significantly, it makes it possible to display a large portion of the <em>Myotis Lucifugus</em> habitats. This is necessary for interpreting which areas of the forest where unavailable for logging. Using the portrait orientation also make it possible, and somewhat easy, to display important information such as the text descriptions explaining the proportion of habitats in each zone and percentage of BEC zones forest areas which cannot be logged. It again allows for information such as legend, north arrow and scale to be easily displayed in the map without sacrificing space. On the other hand, this orientation could make it harder for viewers using a PC or tablet with small screens to easily view the map as they would need to constantly scroll - horizontally or vertically - in order to be able to see the full content of the map. This could affect understanding or interpretation of the map for some audiences.</p>

                                    <p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/RbX54Sr/Conservation-harvest-Planning-lscp.png" alt="map-Landscape" border="2px;" class="center1"></p>

                                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">On the other hand, a landscape orientation enables many different portions of the map to be displayed at once. Specifically, most of the portions - that is, along the horizontal edges of the map - that were hidden in the portrait orientation are easily visible in the landscape version. There is also enough real estate to incorporate information such as legend, scale, north arrow, along with title and general description information that are all relevant for interpreting the results displayed on the map. In the end, I think it would be appropriate to implement something of a cross between portrait and landscape orientations as this will allow exploiting the strength of both orientations while using one to cancel out most of the weaknesses of the other. Yes, I'm sure there is a better option. I just cannot think of any now.</p>

                            <p>As indicated in the above query, various columns were referenced in two tables: PATRON - given an alias p - and REQUEST - assigned an alias r. For each of the rows in a given table the INNER JOIN clause was used to march it with a row in the other table, thus producing the results above.</p>

                                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">GIS offers vast opportiunities for exploiting cutting edge analysis and visualization to inform decision making in forest and resource conservation management. Results of such analysis often requires taking a lot of factors into consideration. In this project, some of the main factors and considerations are discussed below:</p>
                                    <ol style="font-size: 16px;">
                                        <li>Choosing the <em>Myotis Lucifugus</em> bat species as case study was necessary for creating a broad picture of some of the main threats to forest ecosystems and biodiversity posed by unplanned/ill-managed forest activities like logging</li>
                                        <li>The analysis process relied on certain basic spatial statistics techniques. Although other more advanced statistics would be appropriate in the same situation, using techniques such as count summary and frequency distribution was necessary to help generate a clearer and easily interpretable picture of the results</li>
                                        <li>The spatial analysis undertaken mostly relied on vector data. Although using other data formats such as raster (eg. dem) was possible, the vector datasets we used such as point feature classes for observed myotis habitats allowed quick and easy implementation of processes such as buffering</li>
                                        <li>Although a large portion of the datasets used came with good documentation, several of them also were missing key information. It is also possible that accuracy and precision errors exist in the dataset and could throw in some form of uncertainty or even reliability as far as some of the data used are concerned. Again, the buffer radius used in the analysis was largely based on a guess of what the appropriate length should be as well as what other works - conducted outside the study area, and even BC or Canada as whole - had used. This could have introduced a level of uncertainty in the analysis</li>
                                        <li>More in-depth analysis is needed to generate a broader undertanding of threatened species conservation efforts during forestry activities like logging. Such analysis could take into account other aspects of species ecosystem and habitat trends and characteristics such as nesting and foraging habits. Such analysis would likely need to rely heavily on primary data sources, especially with regard to species habitat location observation in order to generate more reliable results</li>
                                    </ol>
